    "Nowadays the factors that contribute to the advancement and progress of society as well as their effects and consequences are deeply investigated. The **volume of research** is such that it becomes **increasingly difficult** to **assimilate all this information** and extract **useful insights from it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These investigations are usually oriented to **specific topics** and our goal is to **understand the relevance** of these subjects in these papers. In order to do this we have a set of **1082 indicators**, divided between **819 general indicators** (covering a wide range of affairs, from *CO2 production* to *GDP growth*) and **263 cultural indicators**. All of them together are assumed to represent the most important topics that are extensively covered by these studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, language is not *objective* and these indicators have been **arbitrarily** selected (with good reasons, but arbitrarily nevertheless), therefore this method can lead to errors and misunderstandings due to the very *subjective* nature of language itself. From this fact we come up with the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To what extent can we trust this **general** - **cultural** indicators to summarize and understand investigations? \n",
    "* Are **cultural indicators more specific** than their general counterpart? And if so, to what degree are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Analysis we will try to answer these questions and apply the results to real *Papers* and *Reports* such us the **Paris Agreement** or the **Agenda 2030**, as well as matching general and cultural indicators to understand their connections and redundancy to validate this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process will be split in **4 different notebooks** which can be found down below, each one pointing to its proper documentation. This first document (*index*) is the **connecting link** between all of them and its purpose is to make it easier to understand the **big picture** of the project while the other 4 documents will be more **specific and technical**, thus requiring some extra effort to understand what is happening under the hood."
